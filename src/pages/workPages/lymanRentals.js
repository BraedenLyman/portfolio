        <p> Inspired by my brotherâ€™s wedding, where we handmade decor and event items, my family and I launched Lyman Rentals. It is a wedding rental business offering unique, handcrafted pieces. </br></br> </p>
        <p> To establish our online presence quickly, I built our website lymanrentals.ca using Wix, prioritizing speed and ease of use. The site features a clean, visually appealing design with high-quality images of our rentals, easy navigation for browsing inventory, and a seamless contact system for inquiries and bookings. By using Wix, I efficiently created a professional, mobile-friendly website without extensive coding, allowing us to start promoting our business right away.</br></br> </p>
        <p> This project combined creativity with practical execution, turning a personal experience into a functional and marketable online business. </p>
