        <p>Quote Kong is a quoting company in the construction industry that makes it easier for sub-contrators to create and build out quotes for their clients. </p></br>
        <p>The main responsability for this project was to create the SubContractor page that consists of three tabs. 1. Selection of Scope Lines, 2. Send Out for Tender/Bid, and 3. Purchase Order/Award.</p></br>
        <p>Collaborating as a group of 3, my focus was on the front end design. I designed the tables for Tab 2 and 3, adding the necessary information for our client.</p>
